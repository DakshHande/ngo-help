    <h3>How We Cover These Costs</h3>
    <p>These costs are not covered by donor contributions. Instead, they are funded through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google AdSense revenue from ads on certain pages</li>
        <li>Sponsorship agreements and corporate partnerships</li>
        <li>Special fundraising initiatives targeting operational costs</li>

    <div class="trust-section">
        <h3>Ensuring Trust and Accountability</h3>
        <p>We want you to feel confident about where your contributions go. All operational costs are covered independently through ads, sponsorships, and other revenue sources. This allows us to direct 100% of your donations toward our programs in India, helping those in need directly.</p>
        <p>We provide financial reports and regular updates on our website to keep you informed about how we manage costs and ensure transparency. If you have any questions, please feel free to <a href="contact.html">reach out to us</a>, and we will be happy to provide any further details.</p>
