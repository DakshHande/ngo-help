    <h2>QR Code Payments for Enhanced Security</h2>
    <p>We prioritize your privacy by using a QR code-based payment system, which eliminates the need for third-party processors.

        <li><strong>Restricted Access:</strong> Access to personal information is restricted to authorized personnel only, and all staff members are trained on best practices for data protection.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Storage:</strong> We use industry-standard encryption protocols to store any personal data, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or breaches.</li>
    </ul>
